# Animal Parkour

Some game I made for 11 ICT

It just had to fit this criteria:

Using the State Library of Queensland language word lists https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/slq-aboriginal-languages-word-lists, design and develop a game that is both entertaining and educational.

## Disclaimer
- I did not make the characters, nor the animations. Thanks Unreal Engine (Games).
- I did not make the audio, or character selection (Credits: https://youtu.be/3qlRgICRoeA).
- I did not make the textures - Thanks google images.
- I did make/got direct permission for the Indigenous models.
